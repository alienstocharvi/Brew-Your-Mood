Welcome to my very first HTML project! ✨  
This is a cute little coffee order form inspired by pastel café aesthetics. It’s built solely using HTML and CSS, with a cozy and, comforting vibe that lets users choose their preferred coffee based on their mood.

💻 What It Does

This form allows a user to:
- Enter their name or nickname
- Choose their coffee type, milk preference, sweetener, and add-ons
- Select the size of their drink
- Share any special notes or thoughts in a fun "brain dump" section
- Select their current **mood**, which suggests a coffee match!

🌈 Features

- Clean pastel theme with cozy gradients ☁️
- Cute coffee cup emoji ☕ and mood-based dropdown
- Custom styled dropdowns, buttons, and form inputs
- A creative twist: emotional check-in with your order

🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- Google Fonts (`Pacifico`, `Quicksand`)
- Emoji for aesthetic touches ☕💕
